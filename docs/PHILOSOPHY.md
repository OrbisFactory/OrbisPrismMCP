# 🧩 The Developer's Prism: Philosophy and Purpose

**Orbis Prism MCP** is not born to replace, but to **complement**.

### 🤝 The Perfect Complement
In the Hytale ecosystem, the absolute source of truth resides in the [Official and Community Documentation (hytalemodding.dev)](https://hytalemodding.dev/). That is our north star. Orbis Prism does not seek to substitute those master guides; it seeks to be the **electron microscope** that developers use when they need to observe a specific strand of code that hasn't been documented yet or has just changed in the latest version.

### 🚀 Agility in an Evolving World
Hytale is a vibrant and ever-changing universe. With the coexistence of **Release** and **Prerelease** versions, the API can evolve faster than any static documentation can record.
The reason this tool exists is to allow developers to:
1.  **Explore the Unknown**: Instantly navigate new or unexplored code segments.
2.  **Validate Changes**: Compare how a function has mutated between versions.
3.  **Deep Dive Fast**: Remove the friction of searching so that creativity never stops.

### 🧠 The Value of the Developer (Human Oversight)
Orbis Prism is, above all, a **tool**. As such, its power depends on the artisan who wields it.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Results provided by AI and decompilation must always be **reviewed and corroborated**.

This tool enhances capabilities, but it does not replace technical judgment, experience, or a developer's instinct. We elevate the programmer's value by providing precise data, but it is the human who builds the magic.
